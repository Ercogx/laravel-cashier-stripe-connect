## Installation for Single Tenancy Applications

1. Enable Stripe Connect in your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings).
2. Install Cashier: ``composer require laravel/cashier``.
3. Install package: ``composer require expdev07/laravel-cashier-stripe-connect``.
4. Publish migrations ``php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cashier-connect-migrations``.
5. Run migrations: ``php artisan migrate``.
6. Configure Stripe keys for Cashier: [Cashier Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/billing#api-keys).

**Note:** the package will not work as intended if you do not install [Laravel's official Cashier package](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing) first.

## Use

The library builds on the official [Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing) library, so getting up and started is a breeze.

### Setup connected account model

Add the ``Billable`` traits to your model. You can use them individually or together. You can also create your own ``Billable`` trait and put them together there. In 
addition, the model should also implement the ``StripeAccount`` interface.

For the purposes of the examples outlined below we will replicate the marketplace style payment model where you have a Store model and a Customer model.

There are 2 ways in which customers can exist, as customers of the platform (by using destination charges or transfers) or as direct customers of the connected account. We will touch on both examples in this guide.

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Lanos\CashierConnect\Contracts\StripeAccount;
use Laravel\Cashier\Billable as CashierBillable;
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Billable as ConnectBillable;

class Store extends Model implements StripeAccount
{
    use CashierBillable;
    use ConnectBillable;

    ///

}
```

### Create controller

Create a controller to manage on-boarding process. The example below registers an Express account for the store.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\Store;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use URL;

class StripeController extends Controller
{

    /**
     * Creates an onboarding link and redirects the store there.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function board(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        return $this->handleBoardingRedirect($request->store());
    }

    /**
     * Handles returning from completing the onboarding process.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function returning(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        return $this->handleBoardingRedirect($request->store());
    }

    /**
     * Handles refreshing of onboarding process.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function refresh(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        return $this->handleBoardingRedirect($request->store());
    }

    /**
     * Handles the redirection logic of Stripe onboarding for the given store. Will 
     * create account and redirect store to onboarding process or redirect to account 
     * dashboard if they have already completed the process.
     *
     * @param Store $Store
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    private function handleBoardingRedirect(Store $Store): RedirectResponse
    {
        // Redirect to dashboard if onboarding is already completed.
        if ($store->hasStripeAccountId() && $store->hasCompletedOnboarding()) {
            return $store->redirectToAccountDashboard();
        }

        // Delete account if already exists and create new express account with 
        // weekly payouts.
        $store->deleteAndCreateStripeAccount('express', [
            'settings' => [
                'payouts' => [ 
                    'schedule' => [ 
                        'interval' => 'weekly', 
                        'weekly_anchor' => 'friday',
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]);

        // Redirect to Stripe account onboarding, with return and refresh url, otherwise.
        return $store->redirectToAccountOnboarding(
            URL::to('/api/stripe/return?api_token=' . $store->api_token),
            URL::to('/api/stripe/refresh?api_token=' . $store->api_token)
        );
    }

}
```

## Transfers & Payouts Example

```php
// Get store. This store has added the Billable trait and implements StripeAccount.
$store = Store::query()->find(1);

// Transfer 10 USD to the store.
$store->transferToStripeAccount(1000);

// Payout 5 dollars to the store's bank account, which will arrive in 1 week.
$store->payoutStripeAccount(500, Date::now()->addWeek());


```

## Direct Charges Example
In the example below we create a direct charge. A direct charge (present on the shopify style payment model) is as described, a direct transaction between the platforms store (connected account) and the customer. The platform does not interfere with this other than taking platform fees. As a result direct charges do not show on your stripe dashboard but show against hte connected account's dashboard. The connected account is liable for stripe fees. 

```php
// Take payment of 50GBP directly into the connected account
$store->createDirectCharge(5000, 'GBP');
```

## Destination Charges Example
Destination charges are slightly different, they pass through your stripe account but are immediately routed to the connected account once successfully taken. This is typical for payment models like Lyft etc. Again you can extract platform fees during this process too. With destination charges, the platform pays the stripe fees.  

```php
// Take payment of 50GBP and transfer to the connected account.
$store->createDestinationCharge(5000, 'GBP');
```

## Platform Fee Configuration
Against your model you can set the application fee settings. This can either be a percentage or a fixed number. Below both examples are shown of the properties being set against the store model.

When using fixed transaction fee's it's important to note the fees must not be higher than the amount of the transaction. A percentage based fee is always encouraged.

### Percentage based platform fee

```php
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Billable;

class Store extends Model implements StripeAccount{

    use Billable;
    
    public $commission_type = 'percentage';
    public $commission_rate = 5;

}

```

### Fixed based platform fee

```php
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Billable;

class Store extends Model implements StripeAccount{

    use Billable;
    
    public $commission_type = 'fixed';
    public $commission_rate = 500; // E.G. Â£5 application fee

}

```

## Connected Account Customers (For Direct Payments / Subscriptions)

It is now possible for a connected account to have direct customers, so instead of those customers appearing in your platform's stripe dashboard they will appear in the dashboard for the connected account they belong to.

You can now map that functionality to a model. For our example we will make the Customer model a direct customer of the Store Model. We will do that by adding the trait.

```php
public $incrementing = false;
```

## UUID Usage

Some people prefer to use Ordered UUID's, this has become more common since Laravel 9. The package will automatically detect if you are using a non integer primary key on your model, as long as you have the following property set on your model it should work fine.

```php
public $incrementing = false;
```

## Custom Primary Key Usage

This package will correctly recognise your custom primary key, as long as you use the following correctly.

```php
use Lanos\CashierConnect\ConnectCustomer;

class Customer extends Model implements StripeAccount{

    use ConnectCustomer;
   
}

```

Once you have created your customer model you can then create the corresponding stripe customer and map it to the connected account.

Your Store model must have the billable trait for this to work

The customer data is as per the stripe documentation

```php
Customer::createStripeCustomer($store, $customerData)
```

Now your customer model and store model are mapped together and this can be used once the subscription functionality is developed. That is coming next.
