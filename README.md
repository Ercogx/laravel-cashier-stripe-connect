 ## Intro

This package is designed to seamlessly connect all of your eloquent models, mapping them to the relevant stripe entities in order to make a marketplace or payments platform.

## Documentation

We now have a dedicated docs page for this plugin. You can view it [here](https://updev-1.gitbook.io/cashier-for-connect/).

We now roughly support webhooks (Due to flexible nature of connect, you will need to declare handlers yourself) - Follow our guide!
