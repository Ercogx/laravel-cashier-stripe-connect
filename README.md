## Use

The library builds on the official [Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing) library, so getting up and started is a breeze.

### Setup model

Add the ``Billable`` traits to your model. You can use them individually or together. You can also create your own ``Billable`` trait and put them together there. In 
addition, the model should also implement the ``StripeAccount`` interface.

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Contracts\StripeAccount;
use Laravel\Cashier\Billable as CashierBillable;
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Billable as ConnectBillable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements StripeAccount
{
    use CashierBillable;
    use ConnectBillable;

    ///

}
```

### Create controller

Create a controller to manage on-boarding process. The example below registers an Express account for the user.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use URL;

class StripeController extends Controller
{

    /**
     * Creates an onboarding link and redirects the user there.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function board(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        return $this->handleBoardingRedirect($request->user());
    }

    /**
     * Handles returning from completing the onboarding process.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function returning(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        return $this->handleBoardingRedirect($request->user());
    }

    /**
     * Handles refreshing of onboarding process.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function refresh(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        return $this->handleBoardingRedirect($request->user());
    }

    /**
     * Handles the redirection logic of Stripe onboarding for the given user. Will 
     * create account and redirect user to onboarding process or redirect to account 
     * dashboard if they have already completed the process.
     *
     * @param User $user
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    private function handleBoardingRedirect(User $user): RedirectResponse
    {
        // Redirect to dashboard if onboarding is already completed.
        if ($user->hasStripeAccountId() && $user->hasCompletedOnboarding()) {
            return $user->redirectToAccountDashboard();
        }

        // Delete account if already exists and create new express account with 
        // weekly payouts.
        $user->deleteAndCreateStripeAccount('express', [
            'settings' => [
                'payouts' => [ 
                    'schedule' => [ 
                        'interval' => 'weekly', 
                        'weekly_anchor' => 'friday',
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]);

        // Redirect to Stripe account onboarding, with return and refresh url, otherwise.
        return $user->redirectToAccountOnboarding(
            URL::to('/api/stripe/return?api_token=' . $user->api_token),
            URL::to('/api/stripe/refresh?api_token=' . $user->api_token)
        );
    }

}
```

## Transfers & Payouts Example

```php
// Get user. This user has added the Billable trait and implements StripeAccount.
$user = User::query()->find(1);

// Transfer 10 USD to the user.
$user->transferToStripeAccount(1000);

// Payout 5 dollars to the user's bank account, which will arrive in 1 week.
$user->payoutStripeAccount(500, Date::now()->addWeek());


```

## Direct Charges Example
In the example below we create a direct charge. A direct charge (present on the shopify style payment model) is as described, a direct transaction between the platforms user (connected account) and the customer. The platform does not interfere with this other than taking platform fees. As a result direct charges do not show on your stripe dashboard but show against hte connected account's dashboard. The connected account is liable for stripe fees. 

```php
// Take payment of 50GBP directly into the connected account
$user->createDirectCharge(5000, 'GBP');
```

## Destination Charges Example
Destination charges are slightly different, they pass through your stripe account but are immediately routed to the connected account once successfully taken. This is typical for payment models like Lyft etc. Again you can extract platform fees during this process too. With destination charges, the platform pays the stripe fees.  

```php
// Take payment of 50GBP and transfer to the connected account.
$user->createDestinationCharge(5000, 'GBP');
```

## Platform Fee Configuration
Against your model you can set the application fee settings. This can either be a percentage or a fixed number. Below both examples are shown of the properties being set against the user model.

When using fixed transaction fee's it's important to note the fees must not be higher than the amount of the transaction. A percentage based fee is always encouraged.

### Percentage based platform fee

```php
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements StripeAccount{

    use Billable;
    
    public $commission_type = 'percentage';
    public $commission_rate = 5;

}

```

### Fixed based platform fee

```php
use Lanos\CashierConnect\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements StripeAccount{

    use Billable;
    
    public $commission_type = 'fixed';
    public $commission_rate = 500; // E.G. Â£5 application fee

}

```


## UUID Usage

Some people prefer to use Ordered UUID's, this has become more common since Laravel 9. The package will automatically detect if you are using a non integer primary key on your model, as long as you have the following property set on your model it should work fine.

```php
public $incrementing = false;
```

## Custom Primary Key Usage

This package will correctly recognise your custom primary key, as long as you use the following correctly.

```php
protected $primaryKey = 'your_primary_key';
```
